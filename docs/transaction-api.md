# Transaction API

## Quote

The wallet creates a quote on behalf of a user by passing details to `Mutation.createQuote`.

First, the recipient Open Payments account or incoming payment is resolved. Then, the STREAM sender quotes the payment to probe the exchange rate, compute a minimum rate, and discover the path maximum packet amount.

The quote may fail in cases such as if the payment pointer or account URL was semantically invalid, the incoming payment was already paid, a terminal ILP Reject was encountered, or the rate was insufficient; or in the case of some transient errors, such as if the Open Payments HTTP query failed, the quote couldn't complete within the timeout, or no external exchange rate was available.

If the STREAM sender successfully established a connection to the recipient and discovered rates and the path capacity, Rafiki sends the quote details to the wallet's configured quote endpoint. If the quote is acceptable and the `sendAmount.value` does not exceed sender's account balance, the wallet returns `201` with the quote. The wallet may also adjust quote amounts as follows:

- If `quote.paymentType` is `FIXED_SEND`, `receiveAmount.value` may be reduced.
- If `quote.paymentType` is `FIXED_DELIVERY`, `sendAmount.value` may be increased.

Rafiki assigns a deadline based on the expected validity of its slippage parameters for the wallet to fund the payment and returns the created quote.

## Outgoing Payment Lifecycle

### Payment creation

The wallet creates a payment on behalf of a user by passing details to `Mutation.createOutgoingPayment`. The payment is created in the `FUNDING` state.

### Funding

After the payment is created, Rafiki notifies the wallet operator via an `OUTGOING_PAYMENT_CREATED` [webhook event](#webhooks) to reserve the maximum requisite funds for the payment attempt by moving `sendAmount.value` from the funding wallet account owned by the payer to the payment account.

If the wallet funds the payment, the state advances to `SENDING`.

### Payment execution

To send, an instance acquires a lock on a payment with a `SENDING` state.

The instance sends the payment with STREAM, which uses the quote parameters.

After the payment completes, the instance releases the lock on the payment and advances the state depending upon the outcome:

1. Success. If the STREAM sender successfully fulfilled the completion criteria of the payment, sending or delivering the requisite amount, the payment is complete. The instance advances the state to `COMPLETED`, the final state of the payment.
2. Irrevocable failure. In cases such as if the exchange rate changed (the payment cannot be completed within the parameters of the quote), the payment failed permanently, and the state advances to `FAILED`.

   After too many recoverable failures and attempts, Rafiki may also consider a payment permanently failed, advancing the state to `FAILED`.

3. Recoverable failure. Rafiki may elect to automatically retry the payment. The state remains `SENDING`, but internally tracks that the payment failed and when to schedule another attempt. Includes cases such as:
   - an idle timeout
   - the receiver closed the connection
   - a terminal ILP Reject was encountered

### Payment resolution

In the `COMPLETED` and `FAILED` cases, the wallet is notifed of any remaining funds in the payment account via `OUTGOING_PAYMENT_COMPLETED` and `OUTGOING_PAYMENT_FAILED` [webhook events](#webhooks).

## Incoming Payment Lifecycle

### Incoming payment creation

An incoming payment is created according to the [Open Payments](https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference/create-incoming-payment) specification. Rafiki creates a payment account for each incoming payment.

### Receiving

An incoming payment receives funds via Interledger as long as it is not complete or expired.

### Expiry and Completion

An incoming payment expires when it passes the `expiresAt` time.

An incoming payment is completed when it has received its specified `incomingAmount.value` or when it is completed manually via an API call.

When the incoming payment expires, Rafiki notifies the wallet of received funds via the `INCOMING_PAYMENT_EXPIRED` [webhook event](#webhooks).

When the incoming payment is completed, Rafiki notifies the wallet of received funds via the `INCOMING_PAYMENT_COMPLETED` [webhook event](#webhooks).

An expired incoming payment that has never received money is deleted.

## Webhooks

Rafiki sends webhook events to notify the wallet of payment lifecycle states that require liquidity to be added or removed.

Webhook event handlers must be idempotent and return `200` on success. Rafiki will retry unsuccessful webhook requests for up to one day.

### `EventType`

#### `INCOMING_PAYMENT_EXPIRED`

Incoming payment has expired.

Credit `incomingPayment.received` to the wallet balance for `incomingPayment.accountId`, and call `Mutation.withdrawEventLiquidity` with the event id.

#### `INCOMING_PAYMENT_COMPLETED`

Incoming payment has received its specified `incomingAmount`.

Credit `incomingPayment.received` to the wallet balance for `incomingPayment.accountId`, and call `Mutation.withdrawEventLiquidity` with the event id.

#### `OUTGOING_PAYMENT_CREATED`

Payment created and needs liquidity in order to send quoted amount.

To fund the payment, deduct `sendAmount.value` from the wallet balance for `payment.accountId` and call `Mutation.depositEventLiquidity` with the event id.

#### `OUTGOING_PAYMENT_FAILED`

Payment failed.

Credit `payment.balance` to the wallet balance for `payment.accountId`, and call `Mutation.withdrawEventLiquidity` with the event id.

#### `OUTGOING_PAYMENT_COMPLETED`

Payment completed sending the quoted amount.

Credit `payment.balance` to the wallet balance for `payment.accountId`, and call `Mutation.withdrawEventLiquidity` with the event id.

#### `WEB_MONETIZATION_RECEIVED`

Account has web monetization balance to be withdrawn.

Credit `amount` to the wallet balance for `accountId`, and call `Mutation.withdrawEventLiquidity` with the event id.

### `Quote`

The quote must be created with `receiver` and (`sendAmount` xor `receiveAmount`) or no specified amount (assuming the Incoming Payment has an `incomingAmount`).
